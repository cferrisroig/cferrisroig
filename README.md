Mechanical engineer interested in coding and web-development
------------------------------------------------------------

Althought I studied Mechanical Engineering, I have been since very young interested in computers and coding. I use Python to automate tasks and do data analysis at work. And during my free time I am decided to learn web-development. I started doing basic modifications in the front-end of my old WordPress blogs using HTML & CSS. Now I am learning JS and PHP because I want to convert my ideas into full-stack applications.
